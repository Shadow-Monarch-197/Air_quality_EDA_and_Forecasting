## Air_quality_EDA_and_Forecasting
The project does data analysis (EDA) on air quality data from 2010 to 2023, identifying trends and seasonal
variations in pollutant levels.
Key findings included the concentration of specific substances during different times of the year.
Compared the performance of various ML models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, to predict
future air quality
